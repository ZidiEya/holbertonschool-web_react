🌐 What is Webpack?
Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When Webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph, mapping every module your project needs and bundling them into one or more static assets (usually .js files).

🔧 Why Use Webpack?
✅ Bundles JavaScript, CSS, images, and more into efficient static assets.

🚀 Improves performance by reducing the number of files and optimizing them.

📦 Supports module systems like CommonJS, AMD, and ES6.

🔁 Enables hot reloading during development.

✨ Works well with frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, jQuery, etc.

🏗️ Core Concepts
Entry: The entry point file that Webpack uses to start building the dependency graph.

Output: Where to emit the bundled files.

Loaders: Transform files (e.g., Babel transpiling, CSS processing).

Plugins: Extend Webpack’s capabilities (e.g., minification, asset management).

Mode: Sets Webpack's built-in optimizations for development or production.

📦 Simple Webpack Workflow
bash

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
Your folder structure might look like:

pgsql
Copier
Modifier
task_0/
├── src/
│   └── index.js
├── dist/
│   └── index.html
├── package.json
└── node_modules/
Build your project with:

bash
Copier
Modifier
npx webpack
Webpack by default will:

Look for ./src/index.js

Output to ./dist/main.js

🧠 Summary
Webpack helps manage and bundle all the resources your application needs. Whether it's a small JavaScript project or a complex React/Vue app, Webpack ensures your files are optimized, modular, and production-ready.
